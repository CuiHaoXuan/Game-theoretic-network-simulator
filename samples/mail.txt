Readable, but revision is needed in some parts. (3)

> *** Strong Aspects: Comments to the author: what are the strong aspects of the paper?

This paper proposes multipath routing algorithm against selfish nodes in ad-hoc network. And computer simulation confirms that the proposed algorithm can reduce the data loss.

> *** Weak Aspects: Comments to the author: what are the weak aspects of the paper?

The reson why the node becomes selfish is not clear. Does the benign node change to the selfish node?

> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes. Please indicate any changes that should be made to the paper if accepted.

Please explain the reson why the node becomes selfish.

Secure routing researches are vital.  Selfish behavior
can have drastic impacts on network behavior. We have
proposed a Selfish-Tolerant Multipath Routing (STMR) protocol
which detects and punishes all types of selfish behavior known so
far. STMR utilizes a proactive approach to enforce cooperation.
In addition, it uses a novel data redirection method to mitigate
selfish behavior impact on network performance. STMR
promises establishing a safe route if network graph remains
connected after eliminating selfish nodes. Simulation results show
that STMR performance outperforms AOMDV and it reduces
data loss considerably. A low overhead leads to a great reduction
in benign nodes' power consumption. STMR is robust against
selfish behavior and it is resilient to complex attacks as well.
